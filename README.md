# ColorYoink
A simple windows application that hides politely in the background apps tray until you press Ctrl + Alt + C and then it copies a color from the screen to your clipboard at the location of the mouse pointer. It is able to rip colors from any application and quickly and easily import them into your drawings or other apps.
